![wall_street](images/wall_street.png)

## Task
This task gives an excel sheet containing stock trades throughout the year. It shows the daily updates for a number of stocks, but that information is not efficient when trying to analyze overall trends. In order to account for this, the VBA script must take daily prics changes and volume to output statistics that can be used to better analyze the market for the year.

## Result
With one command, the macro inserts the stocks' positive or negative yearly change, percent change, and volume. In addition, it will also insert the stock with the greatest percent changes and greatest volume for the year. This occurs simultaneously throughout all worksheets factoring in thousands of rows of input. 

Due to the large file size, screenshots of the result can be found in the "Images" folder.
