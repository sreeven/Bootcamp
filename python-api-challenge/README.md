# Python API Challenge

## WeatherPy
The assignment utilizes Open Weather's API to gather weather statistics around the world to spot general trends. By sampling 600+ cities world-wide, we can apply see how a location's latitude affects factors such as: 
- Temperature
- Humidity
- Cloudiness
- Wind Speed

A full list of the sampled cities and their weather conditions can be found in the "Output" folder.
Visualizations of the data can be found in the Output folder.

## VacationPy
With such drastic differences in weather around the world, it is important to be aware of a city's weather before traveling. Also, where do you stay?
VacationPy uses the sampled list from WeatherPy and plots the cities along with a heat map using Google's Map API.
