- there has been a sharp decline in the number of users as 2020 ended with over 3 million customers and 10.5 million subscribers while 2021 ended with 500K customers and 650K subscribers

- there are more subscribers as we head into the cluster
- trips are overall shorter at the end of 2021 than in 2020
